### Biguo Xin - Full stack egineer

```
I'm a self-motivated man who loves very much about programming.

I do always learn before I invent so that my colleagues don't have to deal with "genius" code.

Programming skills are like wands for wizards, they can help build many amazing things in a fantastic way.
But unlike magic, programing is about simplicity, readability. 

And that's what I do, build awesome(hopefully) things with simple readable code.
