### Biguo Xin - Full stack egineer

```
I'm a self motivated man who loves very much about programing.

I do always learn before I invent, so that my colleagues don't have to deal with "geinus" code.

Programing skills are like wands for wizzards, they can help build many amazing things in fantasitc way.
But unlike magic, programing is about simplicity, readbility. 

And that's what I do, build awesome(hopefully) things with simple readble code.
